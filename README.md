# PicnicWeather

### Description
This repo is for the UCLA fullstack program bootcamp, module 6.<br>
This program helps users plan thier travel based on weather conditions<br>
Searching a city allows the weather API to fetch relevant weather data, both current conditions and a 5 day forecast<br>
Every search is saved in the side bar so users can easily jump between the various cities they plan to travel and see the local conditions<br>
The module 6 assignment provides the following as a guideline and criteria for the assignment:

### User Story 
AS A traveler<br>
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities<br>
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly<br>

### Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs<br>
WHEN I search for a city<br>
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history<br>
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed<br>
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city<br>
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity<br>
